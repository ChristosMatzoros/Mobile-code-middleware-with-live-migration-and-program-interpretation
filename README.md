# Mobile-code-middleware-with-live-migration-and-program-interpretation
We implemented from scratch a mobile code middleware. We created a distributed execution environment that supports the interpretation and execution of a Simple-Script(basic language) program. This Simple-Script language supports basic operations and send/receive commands with CSP semantics. The mailbox technique was used for communication between the different programs. The middleware supports the strong migration of a Simple-Script program to another machine/environment. Also, we implemented a symmetric and deterministic load balancing algorithm that supports the automatic migration of the Simple-Script programs. (In Python)
